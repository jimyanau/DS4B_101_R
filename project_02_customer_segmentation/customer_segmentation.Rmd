## Problem Statement

Marketing would like to increase email campaign engagement by segmenting the customer-base using their buying habbits. 

## Solution Summary

__TODO: INSERT ANALYSIS AND HEAT MAP__


## Customer Preferences

### Heat Map

Our customer-base consists of 30 bike shops. Several customers have purchasing preferences for Road or Mountain Bikes based on the proportion of bikes purchased by category_1 and category_2.

```{r, fig.height=12}
# PLOT CUSTOMER HEAT MAP
plot_customer_heatmap(interactive = params$interactive)
```

### Customer Segmentation

This is a 2D Projection based on customer similarity that exposes 4 clusters, which are key segments in the customer base.

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
# PLOT CUSTOMER SEGMENTS
plot_customer_segments(interactive = params$interactive, k = 4, seed = 123)
```


### Customer Preferences By Segment

__TODO: INSERT ANALYSIS AND HEAT MAP__

```{r, fig.height=8}
# PLOT CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR

```
